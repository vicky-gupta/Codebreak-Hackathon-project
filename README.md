# Codebreak-Hackathon-project
This was an hackathon which was held on  14th and 15th March 2019. It was 24 hour hackathon in which we have secured 1st rank for our unique idea.
It is a team Project.

**Our Problem:** Our problem statement is now a day many busy people are facing more problems regarding their health due to their busy life they are not to able to monitor their health condition properly. And they get easily sick or committed to weakness just because they are not able to update their health and sometimes if we did not mind them then these small diseases can be fatal in future. So we have to make a system which can help them out to monitor their own health problems and the all the received data can be used in treatment of that individual.


**Introduction:** According to our theme i.e. Smart Hospital we will make our health care system more smart by adding some feature and application. We are making a hardware device named smart health monitoring system which will be use to monitor health condition by means of some sensors like temperature sensor for measuring body temperature, pulse rate sensor for measuring pulse rate, calories burned, numbers of steps, sleep quantity and we can also measure stress level of a patient by relative pulse rate monitoring. Then we will collect all the data from sensors and it will be send to the server by internet then from the server it will send to the mobile application of doctors.


**Pros: 
1.	Immediate Action can be taken in the case of emergency.
**Cons:
1.	If any case the internet is not available then our system will fail.**


**Proposed Working/Model:** The all sensors will connect to our ESP8266 WiFi development Board and then the ESP8266 will be connected to the server i.e. Firebase with the help of Internet. Firebase is an online platform where we can save our real time data and then we can send it to a application which will be made by us.
ESP8266 is a module which consist of WiFi and can be connect to Internet and then we can send our data to any other client which is far away from our module but condition there should be the internet connection. For sending data we have to store our data to any server after which can send to the client regardless of his distance from the source. Here we are using Google Firebase which is a mobile and web application development platform where we can store our data to send on app. 

**Some feature of our System:** 
1.	In real time the health information of patient will be detected by which if the doctor notice any fluctuation in health graph then he can immediately advice and inform to the patient.
2.	In any sever case detected then it will send alert to doctors on which they can take immediate action.
3.	There is a threshold of every required quantity will be set. By which if the patient drinks less water then required then a alert will send to the patient.
4.	If any case patient sleep lesser then required or his pulse rate is abnormal then a alert will send to the patient and doctor a well.
5.	By our device we can also measure air quality of the current place and atmosphere where the patient is taking the breath if any wrong detected then a alert will send to the patient to leave the place immediately.



Thankyou
